### iPhone App for Creative Doodling

<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/pastel-finger/id333267689?mt=8">Pastel Finger</a> is a fun app for doodling, with an element of randomness. It gives you a spinning "brush" which cycles through colours as you draw. You can layer the colours and build it up, with results that can be reminiscent of oil pastels.

The results can be unexpected. Give it to your kids to see what they will surprise you with. I could barely get my nine-year-old off it (or my wife).

The interface is simple: Draw with your finger, shake to erase.

Coming soon: you'll be able to save the drawing, use it as a desktop image, or send it to a friend. Let me know what else you'd like to see.
