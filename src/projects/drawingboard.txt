### OS X Animation for kids of all ages

Drawing Board is a tool I'm writing for my kids, to let them do "sketch-based" animations easily.  It is still a bit rough around the edges, but it allows you to create new frames, remove frames, draw (of course), and it has single-layer onion-skinning to guide the animation. It can export frames as PNG, GIF, or JPEG, and it can export the animations as SVG (Quicktime and Flash coming soon).  More upcoming features will be listed in the issue tracker.
