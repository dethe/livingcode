### Happy Halloween

We followed <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Yip-Yip-Costume/">instructions</a> Seth found on Instructables to make these costumes, and got rave reviews everywhere we went, especially from parents old enough to remember the Martians on Sesame Street. For those of you who don't, YouTube has a bunch of their videos. This one is my favourite:

Azlen and I did the pumpkin carving. He made the witch with very little help from me (and he made the Halloween picture above in <a href="">Vector Designer</a>

I made the Cthulhu Jack-o-lantern based off an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26904612@N05/2978341687/">image I found on Flickr</a>. Mine didn't turn out so nice, but I'm happy with it.

And now everyone is exhausted and crashing from the sugar high. We now return you to your regularly scheduled November.
