My friend and neighbor Malcolm Ferrier has been at work for the past couple of years writing, shooting, and editing a science fiction movie called Stop. It's going to premier on Friday, and based on the unfinished version I saw last year it should be a lot of fun. Malcolm and I share an interest in amateur movie-making, but he has taken it much futher than I and actually made a feature film. It's been an exciting process to watch, and I can't wait to see the finished version.

> After two years of hard work, STOP the motion picture is finally finished and I wanted to invite you to the premiere. It takes place at the BCIT Telus Theatre (SE6-233), 3700 Willingdon Avenue, Burnaby, BC at 7:00 PM on Friday, May 12th. Admission is free, but donations are accepted for Amnesty International.

Feel free to bring friends and family (as many people as you'd like!).
