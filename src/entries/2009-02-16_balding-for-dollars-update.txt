Well, my Balding for Dollars event was a success.  I have raised $717.37 for Children's Hospital (there is still time to help bring it to my goal of $1000 if you'd like to <a href="http://bcchf.kintera.org/balding/livingcode">donate</a>). Thanks to everyone who helped with donations, words of support, and especially to <a href="http://flee.com/">Frank</a> for his photography, to Berenice for helping with the cutting, to my wife <a href="http://strangeplaces.livingcode.org/">Daniela</a> for her encouragement and help, and to our kids for their patience.  I couldn't have done it without all of you.

There has been one change of plans.  I had wanted to donate the hair to a Canadian foundation making wigs for kids with cancer, but couldn't find it.  Daniela's google-fu skills were better and tomorrow my hair will go off to the Eva and Co. <a href="http://www.evaandcowigs.com/page129.htm">hair donation</a> program. And to clarify, my son didn't shave his head, we're sending a ponytail from when he went from a long hairstyle to a short one.

Thanks also, to everyone who offered me a toque, but I'm well covered.
