Just for fun, and because I'm trying out two things:

1. Using Ecto for posting again
2. Blogging more often

Here are my results from the latest craze:

    $ history|awk '{a[$2]++} END{for(i in a){printf "%5d\t%s\n",a[i],i}}'|sort -rn|head

    139 ls
    87 cd
    54 python
    43 /usr/bin/python
    38 less
    21 vim
    16 clear
    12 mate
    11 rm
    10 ssh

The first python is the one I built from source so I can include it in applications packaged with py2app, the second is the built-in python for Leopard. Both are version 2.5. The mate program is used to open files in TextMate from the command line.
