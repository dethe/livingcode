Yesterday was my birthday, which really has nothing to do with this, aside from the fact that the following conversation (as well as I was able to capture it from memory later) took place at dinner on that day:

> "Why is the rat food weighed down by a phone book?"
> "Had to, the gravity was pretty iffy yesterday."
> "Iffy?"
> "The gravity was out all over town.  I called BC Gravity, but they just said they were working on it and they'd have gravity restored as soon as they could. They said 2000 homes were affected, but they were working round the clock to get it fixed."

My kids are growing up in a very strange world.
