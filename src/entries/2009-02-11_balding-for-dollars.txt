I usually use this site to try to give back to the community, with Python and Javascript tutorials, software, and the occasional joke. Today I'm going to ask for something in return.  On Saturday, February 14th, 2009 (Valentine's Day, at least in the US and Canada) I will be shaving my head to raise money for Vancouver Children's Hospital as part of their <a href="http://bcchf.kintera.org/balding/livingcode">Balding for Dollars</a> drive.

The picture above was taken today by my friend <a href="http://flee.com/">Frank Lee</a>.  As you can see, my hair is quite long.  I'll be sending my ponytail to <a href="http://www.locksoflove.org/">Locks of Love</a>, who make a wigs for kids who have lost their hair due to medical conditions.  This is my second balding for dollars and will be the fourth ponytail I've donated, and my son is also donating his ponytail.  As I get older, my hair isn't growing in like it used to. This may be my last good ponytail to give, so with your help, I'd like to make a difference.

You can make donations on the Balding for Dollars site <a href="http://bcchf.kintera.org/balding/livingcode">here</a>.  Saturday is only two days away, so be my valentine and help some kids!

I appreciate any help you can give.  Check back on Monday for before/after photos.  Thank you!
