After much delay, my slides are finally up from the VanPyZ talk last week.

<a href="/assets/2005/cocoa.html">Using Python and Cocoa on OS X</a>

Again I'm using Eric Meyer's S5 tool for HTML slides, but it still ends up being a large download because it includes a completely unneccesary quicktime movie. My son and I have been playing with iStopMotion and this was one of our first forays into claymation.

The reason it's in the slideshow, is that movie making is now completely accessible to an eight-year-old, and I want to writing games and other programs equally accessible to him.

Still a ways to goâ€¦
