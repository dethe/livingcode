I forgot to post last week that my latest article for David Mertz's column, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/views/xml/libraryview.jsp?search_by=xml+matters:">XML Matters,</a> went live on the IBM developerWorks site. It's fallen off the front page now, but it was gratifying to make it there. The article is <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-matters48/">Ajax Tradeoffs: The many flavors of XML</a>, and it is an exploration of various XML (Open Office, XHTML, custom) and non-XML (JSON, CSV) formats for data exchange in Ajax-enabled websites. I used my wife Daniela's efforts at tracking her poetry submissions as my example data.

This article was also my pre-announcement of the Fame Not Fortune webapp that I'm working on (off-and-on). I'm using it as a way of learning Django, since I'm already somewhat familiar with TurboGears and I'm using Rails at work. More about Fame Not Fortune later. I'll have a status report on the various livingcode projects soon too: updates for Drawing Board and Pastels, among other things.
