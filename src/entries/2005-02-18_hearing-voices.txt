<a href="http://northernvoice-ca.canadawebhosting.com/">Northern Voices</a>, that is. The local blogging conference is tomorrow and I'll be there, along with my friend and co-worker, <a href="http://www.theirishkid.com/blog/">Michael</a>. While I find the idea of a conference about blogging to be a bit odd, it's a good chance to meet some of the people in person who I only know from blogspace, like <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog">Ted</a> and <a href="http://www.julieleung.com/">Julie,</a> and a chance to catch up with <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing/">Tim</a> and <a href="http://www.laurenwood.org/anyway/">Lauren</a>, who I almost never see even though we live in the same town
