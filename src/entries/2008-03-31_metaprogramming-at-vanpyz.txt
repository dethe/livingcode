Just a reminder for Pythonistas in the Vancouver area: The Vancouver Python and Zope user group (VanPyZ) is tomorrow (Tuesday, April 1). Paul Prescod will be talking about metaprogramming in Python. Details and directions are on the <a href="http://www.vanpyz.org/">VanPyZ site</a>. And, as usual, we'll be heading out to the pub afterwards for more discussion.

Hope to see you there!
