Fractalism

Two important trends: personal manufacturing (fabbing) and urban agriculture.

"Most people who know about "open source" (including Free/Libre software) understand it as a technological model. A smaller group says no, really it's an economic model[...] But while both of these perspectives are narrowly correct, they are also both incomplete. Ultimately, open source is a political model."
