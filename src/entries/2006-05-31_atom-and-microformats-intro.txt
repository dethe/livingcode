My most recent article at IBM <a href="http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml">developerWorks</a> is up (part of David Mertz's "XML Matters" column), discussing the intersection of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt">Atom Syndication Format</a>, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-08.txt">Atom Publishing Protocol</a>, and <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>:

Actually, it's been up for at least a week, but I was out of town at JavaOne (and too tired to post), then off the grid completely taking my son's school to camp. I'm still getting caught up, but nearly recovered.

I think I've figured out why my new blog is not being picked up by <a href="http://planet.python.org/">Planet Python</a> too: the planet software has only recently begun to support Atom 1.0, and that version hasn't been officially released yet. There should be a 1.0 release of the <a href="http://planetplanet.org/">planet</a> code soon, and hopefully Planet Python will upgrade then and all will be well with the world.

I guess that's one downside to developing my own blogging tools to support open standards: I may not have to implement deprecated formats or protocols, but if others are still stuck with legacy systems it can still hurt.
